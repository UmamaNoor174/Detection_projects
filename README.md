# Detection_projects
Here are my recently making new detection based projects.
**Overview:**
This project focuses on detecting [object] using AI and machine learning techniques. It leverages deep learning models to accurately identify and classify instances of [object] from images or video streams.
**Features:**
High Accuracy: Uses state-of-the-art deep learning models.
Automated Detection: Detects [object] with minimal user input.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing images/videos in real-time.
Customizable: Can be fine-tuned with different datasets.
**Dataset:**
The dataset used for training consists of images collected from [different sources]
**Model & Techniques**
Framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch
Architecture: CNN, ResNet, YOLO, etc.
Training Details: Optimizer, learning rate, epochs, etc.
**Usage:**
To run the detection model on an image:
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
**Results**
The model achieves an accuracy.
(Insert sample images)
**Contributing**
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the project.
